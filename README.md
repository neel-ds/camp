# NFT Membership Marketplace - Coinvise
This is an assignment repo of NFT memberships for creators and buyer leveraging few benefits and criteria. 

## üß© Prerequisites & Manual Setup

You must have a wallet to interact with this project. Check out how to create a Metamask wallet from [here](https://metamask.io). Get some ETH on Base Sepolia to test our cool things [here](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia). 

Follow the instructions for the local environment: The user must have Node.js and pnpm to run this platform. Just download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Highlights

This project includes contracts and a Next.js App (App routing) that demonstrates the following features. Contracts: `NFT.sol` is the implementation of ERC1155 with custom specifications and `Launchpad.sol` is the main contract using which creators can ship NFT Memberships. The contract is deployed on [Base Sepolia](https://base-sepolia.blockscout.com/address/0x8e646c314fe1D98b619f46767ee3119F7e7Fb7ae).

1. The app is completely on-chain. The metadata and files are being stored on IPFS using nft.storage. Here, data is handled via smart contract or IPFS. Other ways to handle the extra benefits can also be implemented simply using database (Redis/Supa). 

2. Approximate USD price chip for creators can be easily implemented using Coingecko or exchange API to get real-time price feed. Due to my other commitments, I haven't worked on this.

3. I have used pure tailwind to build this UI and components. Overall, it enhances the build and caching by reducing dependencies.
